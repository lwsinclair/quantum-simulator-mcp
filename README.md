# Quantum Simulator MCP Server

A Docker image providing a quantum circuit simulator that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing integration with MCP clients such as Claude for Desktop.



## Features

- Quantum computing simulator with noise models
- Support for OpenQASM 2.0 quantum circuits
- Quantum circuit simulation using Qiskit
- Support for various noise models (depolarizing, thermal relaxation, readout error)
- Multiple result types including counts, statevector, and visualized histograms
- Pre-configured example circuits
- Seamless integration with MCP clients

## Quick Start

get the docker image

```bash
docker pull ychen94/quantum-simulator-mcp:latest
```


Simply run the container with the following command:

```bash
docker run -i --rm -v /tmp:/data/quantum_simulator_results -e HOST_OUTPUT_DIR="/tmp" ychen94/quantum-simulator-mcp:latest
```

This command:
- Mounts the `/tmp` directory on your host to store histogram output files
- Sets the `HOST_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable to `/tmp`
- Keeps the container running with `-i` (interactive mode)
- Automatically removes the container when it exits with `--rm`

## Using with Claude for Desktop

1. Install Claude for Desktop
2. Edit the Claude configuration file:
   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

3. Add the following configuration to the `mcpServers` section:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "quantum-simulator": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v", "/tmp:/data/quantum_simulator_results",
        "-e", "HOST_OUTPUT_DIR=/tmp",
        "ychen94/quantum-simulator-mcp:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

4. Restart Claude for Desktop
5. Look for the hammer icon in the Claude UI, indicating available MCP tools

## MCP Tools

The server provides the following MCP tools:

- **run_circuit**: Run a quantum circuit with specified noise model
- **list_noise_models**: List all available noise models and their descriptions
- **list_result_types**: List all available result types and their descriptions
- **get_circuit_stats**: Analyze a quantum circuit and return statistics
- **create_test_histogram**: Create a test histogram file to verify output directory configuration

## MCP Resources

The server provides example quantum circuits:

- `qasm://examples/bell-state.qasm`: Bell state preparation circuit
- `qasm://examples/grover-2qubit.qasm`: 2-qubit Grover's algorithm implementation
- `qasm://examples/qft-4qubit.qasm`: 4-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform
- `quantum://noise-models/examples.json`: Example noise model configurations

## Example Usage in Claude

Here are some prompts you can use in Claude:

1. "Run a Bell state circuit and show me the results"

2. "What noise models are available in the quantum simulator?"

3. "Simulate a 2-qubit Grover's algorithm with 0.01 depolarizing noise"

4. "Create a test histogram and show me the file path"

5. "Please provide a simple QAOA algorithm, only get the result_types: histogram, and view the histogram using iterm"

## Volume Mapping

The container generates histogram PNG files in `/data/quantum_simulator_results`. These files need to be accessible from your host system. The volume mapping (`-v /tmp:/data/quantum_simulator_results`) makes these files available in your host's `/tmp` directory.

## Environment Variables

- `QUANTUM_OUTPUT_DIR`: Output directory for histogram files inside the container (default: `/data/quantum_simulator_results`)
- `HOST_OUTPUT_DIR`: Corresponding path on the host system (default: `/tmp`)

## Multi-Architecture Support

This image supports the following architectures:
- linux/amd64
- linux/arm64 (confirmed working on Mac M-series chips)

Note: The image has not been tested on Windows systems yet, but should work as long as Docker Desktop is properly configured.

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Claude cannot access the histogram files.  
**Solution**: Ensure the volume mapping is correct and the `HOST_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable matches the host path in your volume mapping.

**Issue**: Docker container exits immediately.  
**Solution**: Make sure to use the `-i` flag to keep stdin open, which is required for the MCP STDIO transport.
